# REST API & HTTP Cheatsheet

This is a quick reference for REST APIs and HTTP methods — highly relevant for software engineering placements.

## HTTP Methods
| Method | Purpose                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | Retrieve data from the server        |
| POST   | Create new resources                 |
| PUT    | Update existing resources completely |
| PATCH  | Update existing resources partially  |
| DELETE | Remove resources                     |

## Common HTTP Status Codes
| Status Code | Meaning                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| 200         | OK (successful request)        |
| 201         | Created                        |
| 204         | No Content                     |
| 400         | Bad Request                     |
| 401         | Unauthorized                   |
| 403         | Forbidden                       |
| 404         | Not Found                       |
| 500         | Internal Server Error           |

## REST API Best Practices
1. Use proper HTTP methods for actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
2. Use meaningful endpoint names (`/users`, `/orders`)
3. Return proper status codes for success and errors
4. Version your API (`/api/v1/resource`)
5. Use JSON as standard format for request/response
